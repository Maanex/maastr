# maastr

An easy to use "custom text format parser".
Quick example to explain things:
```js
let text = 'My %custom **FORMAT**%';
let tokens = {
    '%': 'flipped',
    '**': 'bold'
};
maastr.parse(text, tokens);

// Returns:
"My <span class="flipped">custom <span class="bold">FORMAT</span></span>"
```

You can define your own tokens and parse your custom string formatting, ready to be styled in css.

## Getting Started

### Importing the lib

For using it in the browser, either use Github as your CDN and import it as the following:
```html
<script src="./maastr.js"></script>
```

Or choose your version above and download the required files.

An npm module has not yet been created. You can download the files though to use it server-sided.

### Implementing a custom parser

Everything this api has to offer is bundled into the `maastr` object.
To parse a string, you can use the following method:
```js
maastr.parse(string, tokens?, settings?); // returns: string
```

`tokens` needs to be an object with your tokens as keys and the output classname as values. Example:
```js
{
    '**': 'bold',
    '__': 'underline',
    '~~': 'strikethrough',
    '*': 'italic'
}
```
**The maximum token length for now is limited to two!**

`settings` can be left out for now. For more information, have a look below:

## Advanced

### Settings

The `maastr.parse(...)` method takes in an optional third parameter labeled settings. A settings object looks like this, each parameter is optional and can be left out:
```js
{
    htmlTag: 'span', // The HTML tag of the output. <span> is default but if you need a <div> for example, here's where to change that
    prefix: '', // Adds text infront of the output. Can be used to wrap the whole generated HTML into another block to target styling more precisely
    suffix: '', // Same as prefix but after the output
}
``` 

### Default Tokens

If you use the same custom formatting everywhere in your project, it can be frustrating to always provide the `parse` method with the tokens. To make things easier, you can set a default `tokens` object using:
```js
maastr.default.tokens = { ... }
```

### Default Settings

Just as you can change the default tokens, you can also change the default settings. Here's how:
```js
maastr.default.settings = { ... }
```
